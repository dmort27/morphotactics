class Slot:
  """
  A slot is analogous to a continuation class in LEXC.
  It is acceptable that a slot for a rule's continuation class has not been declared by the time it is mentioned in a rule - compilation will handle this.
  This function only sets state, rules are processed lazily (i.e. only when compiled). 

  Attributes:
    name: name of the slot
    rules: a list of tuples (upper alphabet symbols, lower alphabet symbols, list of continuation classes, weight)
        example: ('ni-', 'ni', ['RefObj', 'VerbStem'], 0.0)
        a rule's destination state is a final state if continuation classes are empty
        the weight is the weight of the transition from the slot's initial state to this particular rule
    start (optional): the slot is one of the starting slots (root class in LEXC)
